# Support and Community for Developers

We regularly update the documentation for the Bitrix24 REST API and add code examples for typical tasks. However, assistance can be found beyond just this resource.

Below is a list of sources where you can ask questions, find solutions, and participate in the community.

## Video Tutorials

[Bitrix24 REST API Course](https://helpdesk.bitrix24.com/courses/index.php?COURSE_ID=268&INDEX=Y) — a set of lessons with practical examples for creating on-premise and mass-market solutions for Bitrix24.

## Telegram Channel

- [Developing REST Applications for Bitrix24](https://t.me/b24_dev) — a chat for questions about the REST API and creating mass-market solutions and a channel with news and recommendations for application developers.

{% note info "How to Ask Questions in Chats" %}

1. First, search for an answer in the documentation or through search.
2. Try to solve the problem on your own. Even a partial result can help describe the issue more accurately.
3. Ask specific questions. Instead of "I can't add a button, what should I do?", try "I registered the handler in `CRM_DEAL_DETAIL_TAB`, checked with the `placement.list` method — the widget is there. But users do not see it in the deal card."
4. If the method does not work as expected, attach an example of the API request and response.
