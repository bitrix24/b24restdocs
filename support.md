# Support and Community for Developers

## Where to Get Help? {#community}

We strive to enhance our developer documentation by providing practical examples for the most common tasks related to using the Bitrix24 REST API.

In addition to the documentation, you can seek advice and assistance from other developers in the open chat:

- [B24 REST and Apps](https://t.me/b24_dev). This chat discusses questions related to using the REST API and creating local and mass-market solutions.

{% note info "How to Ask Questions in Chats" %}

If you are joining these chats for the first time, it’s advisable to follow some simple guidelines:

1. Before asking a question, try to search for the necessary information in the documentation or through search engines. Chat participants are not search engines to do this for you.
2. Attempt various solutions to your problem. Even if you don't fully succeed, you will be able to articulate your issue more specifically, making the conversation more effective.
3. Try to ask specific technical questions. It’s difficult to respond to a question like "I can't add a button in Bitrix24, what should I do?". It’s easy to answer a question like "I registered a widget handler in CRM_DEAL_DETAIL_TAB from a local application, checked the presence of the widget with a request to the placement.list method, but users accessing the deal detail form do not see my widget."
4. If you believe that a method is not working as expected or as it did previously, provide an example request with the parameters you passed to the method and show the response from the REST API. The issue is always with the data. Until you explain how you specifically used the method, no one will be able to help you.

News, tips, and recommendations for developers of mass-market solutions can always be found in the [Bitrix24.Market Live](https://t.me/b24_dev) channel.

## Technical Support {#support}

Support is provided to developers of [mass-market solutions](./market/index.md) in the developer's area, where you can address both technical issues related to the REST API and questions regarding the placement of solutions in the Bitrix24 Market.
