At the moment, Bitrix24 Market supports two types of application placements: free solutions and free solutions with in-app purchases.

## Free Solutions with In-App Purchases

Completely free solutions do not require payment during the installation and use of the solution. However, developers of solutions have the option to independently charge for certain functionalities of their solutions.

This means that you can monetize your applications in several ways:

1. Offer users a free limited trial of your solution, after which users will need to make a payment to continue using your application.
2. Provide users with a free basic version of your solution and offer extended paid features.
3. Offer users free limited functionality of your solution and provide paid increased limits, quotas, etc.

In the case of accepting payments, it is necessary to specify the option "Users have to pay for external service" in the application card.

You can independently accept payments from clients for additional functionality of your application. Currently, Bitrix24 does not charge a fee for such payments.
