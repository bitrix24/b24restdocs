# Reviews in Bitrix24 Market

Working with reviews is not only a way to receive feedback from users but also an effective tool for promoting your solution. Encourage users to rate and write reviews, and you can secure top positions in the rating sorting on the showcase.

## How does the review system work?

1. A review can be left in the application card on the showcase within the Bitrix24 account; it cannot be done in the catalog on the website.
2. Reviews can only be left on accounts using a commercial pricing plan of Bitrix24. This cannot be done on a demo plan.
3. The publication of a review occurs automatically after 3 days. During this time, developers have the opportunity to thank the client for their feedback or attempt to resolve a negative situation, thereby changing a poor rating.
4. Any user of the account where this application is installed can leave a review about it.
5. Multiple reviews from different users of the account can be left for the same solution.
6. It is impossible to leave a review without installing the application, as it is important for everyone to receive feedback based on real usage experience.

## Why is it important to work with reviews?

It is essential to remember that each review is an opportunity to improve your products and strengthen relationships with clients. Therefore, respond to reviews thoughtfully and respectfully, using them as a valuable tool for development. To ensure you don't miss any reviews, we display a counter for reviews you haven't responded to.

## How to edit a review?

Go to the Market, click "More" in the top right corner, and sel ect "My Reviews." Each review has three dots â€” click on them and choose "Edit Review." The customer can change the text or write a new one and save it.

**Restrictions:**

- A review can be edited only twice within three months from the time it was written.
- If the rating is changed to a positive one, the changes are applied immediately on the storefront.
- If the rating is changed to a negative one, we give partners time to resolve the situation before publication.

**Broadcast user experiences**

New clients will be able to see that the solution works effectively, and they won't waste their time trying to install and configure it. Reviews will also help new clients understand if your solution fits their needs.

**Build relationships with clients**

It is evident that the developer is engaged with the solution and has not neglected it; they will continue to enhance functionality and develop the product while closely monitoring reviews and responding to client requests.

**Assist in promoting the solution**

A review often influences the rating the user gives to the solution. The higher the rating and score of the application, the better its position on the Bitrix24 Market showcase. This affects the solution's standing in the catalog.

**Receive feedback from clients**

Feedback allows developers to gather important information from users: what impression they have of the application, what problems they encounter during use, and what features they feel are lacking.

## How to ask users to leave a review?

You can create a pop-up window that prompts users to rate and opens the detailed page of the application in the Market, where the user can evaluate your solution.

**Implementing functionality at the code level**

- Connect the special [js-library](../../api-reference/bx24-js-sdk/index.md) for working with the Bitrix24 REST API.
- Call the [openPath](../../api-reference/bx24-js-sdk/additional-functions/bx24-open-path.md) function, passing the path to the detailed page of your application on the Market showcase.

You can download the code example [here](https://bitrix24.team/~UkhoQ).

The best option is to ask the user to rate the application after they have confirmed its usefulness.

## Responding to users

Responding to client reviews should be done carefully and professionally to demonstrate care for clients and a desire to meet their needs. Therefore, we have compiled a list of recommendations for effective engagement:

**BE GRATEFUL**
Start your response with gratitude for the review. Show the client that you appreciate their time and effort spent writing the review.

**PERSONALIZE THE RESPONSE**
Mention the client's name in your response to show that you are addressing them personally. This creates a more individualized and trusting impression.

**ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE**
If the review contains negative comments or complaints, do not ignore them. Acknowledge the issue and express regret for the client's unsatisfactory experience.

**BE EMPATHETIC**
Show the client that you understand their feelings and disappointment. Express regret and promise to take steps to improve the situation.

**OFFER A SOLUTION**
Provide the client with a specific solution to the problem or a way to enhance their experience.

**BE PROFESSIONAL**
Your response should be polite, well-written, and professional. Avoid emotional reactions or disputes with the client. Strive to maintain good relationships and show that you are ready to resolve the issue.

**CONCLUDE THE RESPONSE POSITIVELY**
Your response should be polite, well-written, and professional. Avoid emotional reactions or disputes with the client. Strive to maintain good relationships and show that you are ready to resolve the issue.

## Resolving contentious situations

There may be situations where a user leaves an inadequate, biased review of the solution, negatively impacting the developer's reputation.

We strive to support solution developers, and you can always reach out to the moderator chat; we will review your situation separately.
