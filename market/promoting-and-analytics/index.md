# Promotion in the Bitrix24 Market

Before you start developing solutions, it's advisable to understand how you will market them later and what opportunities and tools our showcase provides for this.

## How to Inform Bitrix24 Users About Your Application?

We strive to direct users to applications directly within Bitrix24, offering ready-made solutions right where they can use them. All you need to do is add [embedding your application](../../api-reference/widgets/index.md) as Bitrix24 widgets.

### Widgets in Applications

If your application adds a widget (or multiple widgets), we begin recommending your application to users in the selection of "suitable" applications for each specific widget embedding location. Here's how it looks with applications that add additional widgets as tabs in the CRM detail form.

When a user clicks on the "Market" item, we display a slider with a selection of relevant solutions.

The same applies to solutions that add workflow activities, automation rules, etc. – we will recommend your solutions right within the corresponding tools.

The more integration and embedding scenarios you implement, the more frequently your application will "catch the user's eye."

## How to Stand Out Among Other Solutions?

A well-crafted description of your application that helps potential users understand what problems your application will solve is key to success. Ensure your description answers the main question: **why do users need the application**. It's worse if the description answers the question "what does" the application do – as this means the user has to figure out why they need everything that "what does" the application provides.

### Clear Title

There are many solutions in the Market, and a user is more likely to open the application that interests them from the list of alternatives. Therefore, the title should be clear and concise, fitting on the screen when viewing the list.

### Brief Description

In addition to the title, it's important to provide a clear and compelling brief description of the application. It should complement, not duplicate, the title and be short enough to fit entirely in the application lists.

Do not copy the title into the brief description. Remove introductory words and phrases. Write concisely and clearly about the purpose.

### Informative Screenshots

Another important aspect is high-quality screenshots that showcase real use cases of the application. Screenshots should also help the user understand why they need this application and how they can use it. Do you think a screenshot of the settings interface or a screenshot with a successful installation message is helpful in this regard? If in doubt, it likely means it's not. Consider other options.

## How to Help Users Find Your Application?

Tell potential clients how your solution has already benefited other companies, work with collections, reviews, and utilize the potential of keywords for quick and effective searching.

### Thematic Collections

In the Market showcase, you will find a variety of thematic collections of solutions. They are available both on the main page and in various sections of the product where users search for the necessary functionality.

We gather interesting and useful applications and compile reviews from them.

Browse the showcase, find a suitable category, and reach out to the moderators. If your solution matches in theme and functionality, we will add it to the collection.

### Working with Reviews

Working with reviews is a way to receive feedback from users and an effective tool for promoting your application.

High ratings and positive reviews will help you rank higher in the sorting by rating in the Marketplace showcase.

Why is this important? - The solution will automatically rise to the top of the results and will be one of the first that a potential client sees.

### Search Engine Optimization

A significant portion of solution installations in the Market occurs through search, where we strive to show applications that are most relevant to the queries.

To form the search index, we use (in order of influence):

- the application title;
- keywords you specify in your solution's detail form;
- the full description of the application.

Here are the rules for using keywords:

1. The most important words should be in the title; less important ones in the "keywords" field, and the broadest range in the application description;
2. The further left a word is positioned in the title, keywords, and description, the higher the weight of that word. For example, for the query "inventory," an application titled "**Inventory** and accounting" will rank higher than "Automation of **inventory**."
3. The shorter the text, the higher the weight of each word in that text. For example, for the query "automation," an application titled "Automation and Triggers" (3 words) will rank higher than "Automation and Triggers for CRM" (5 words).

You need to decide which keywords are most interesting to you and optimize the content in your application's detail form accordingly. It won't be possible to equally succeed in comparison with other applications at high positions simultaneously for a large number of different words.
