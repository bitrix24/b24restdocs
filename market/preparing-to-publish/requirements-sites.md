# Ready-Made Websites in Bitrix24

## What is a Website Template

**Ready-made website templates in Bitrix24** are a separate type of solution in the Bitrix24 Market that does not require programming and does not use the Bitrix24 REST API. When such a solution is installed, clients receive a website that is fully ready for use.

## How to Create and Publish a Template in the Market

You assemble a template on your account from available or third-party blocks from Market applications, create attractive demo content relevant to the template's theme, click the "Export" button, and your Bitrix24 magically compiles and exports an archive with your ready-made website template, which you just need to upload in the partner's account and publish. Everything is done super quickly, and you don't even need to dive into the code.

**1. CHOOSE A THEME**

Decide on the theme of the future website template. Choose one that you have enough expertise and experience in implementing.

**2. DESIGN THE LOGIC**

Determine what content and elements should be on the website to achieve the client's goals. Develop a sales scenario that will guide potential buyers to a successful deal or desired action.

**3. FILL WITH CONTENT**

Create or prepare content for the website, including text, images, and other materials.

**4. TRAIN THE DESIGNER**

So that they can easily work with the available tools and create a beautiful and appealing design for the website, considering the chosen theme and logic.

**5. GET THE RESULT**

After completing the work on the design and content, your template is ready for publication in the Market; it just needs to be exported from the account and uploaded to the Developer's area.

## Technical Recommendations

Bitrix24 Product Manager Olga Chepyuk and website team developer Andrey Bochkov have compiled a list of technical recommendations to consider when creating templates:

1. It is best to assemble templates on the latest version of Bitrix24, which is usually cloud-based;
2. The smaller the template archive size, the better; for this, it is advisable to compress images to a size of no more than 300kb, which is the optimal image size without quality loss;
3. Archive: no more than 10mb (exceptions may be made in special cases).
4. Name the template archive strictly in English without spaces to minimize issues during moderation and uploading the template to the showcase;
5. Use only "website design," NOT "page design," so that if users want to make slight adjustments to the website, they will be less confused;
6. A super block for use is encouraged;
7. Try to create the maximum number of blocks for all screen resolutions, reducing the number of "duplicate blocks" depending on the screen resolution (it is better to have 1 block for desktop, tablet, and phone than 3 blocks for each of these screens).

## Content Recommendations

We also provide recommendations for working with images and texts, as it is primarily the visuals and content that attract clients to the template.

1. Choose a name for your template that is as concise as possible and reflects the template's theme.
2. The template preview and the preview image of the rich link look better without text, and it's a great option if they reflect the template's theme;
3. Check the texts for typos, and try to align them so they look as appealing as possible;
4. It is better to use a single font rather than 100 different ones in one template;
5. Use modern fonts unless you aim to create a vintage or anti-trendy website;
6. The predominant color for accents in the template should be the one you assigned in the "color palette" within the "website design";
7. It is better to use photos from the unsplash library or other libraries that use a free-to-use license to avoid issues with copyright holders;
8. In photographs, it is better to avoid the appearance of third-party brand logos, as well as watermarks and other distracting elements;
9. It is better to upload photos directly into the template rather than inserting images via direct links, so that if the photo is deleted from the resource, it does not disappear from the template, which is more reliable;
10. You can use AI to generate images (but the images will only be truly high-quality if you know how to compose prompts);
11. If you use emojis, check the import on any test account to see if they load correctly.
12. All materials included in the template must not violate the rights of third parties. That is, you must either be the copyright holder, or the license for the materials used must allow distribution.
