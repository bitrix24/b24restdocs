# Guidelines for Successful and Quick Moderation

We offer you a minimal checklist for self-verification before submitting solutions for moderation:

- **Come up with an appropriate app name**. "Test App #1" will not pass moderation.
- **Provide a clear and understandable description** of what your app does, how to set it up, and how to contact your tech support. Naturally, this should comply with all spelling and punctuation norms.
- **Check the videos and images in the description** to ensure they open correctly, with no broken images or videos hidden by privacy settings.
- **Create a good icon** - square, up to 650*650 px with a high-quality image, free of pixelation, blurriness, etc.
- **Attach informative screenshots**. There must be high-quality full-screen screenshots of your solution's interface in the context of Bitrix24.
- **Provide links to your license agreement and personal data processing policy for your software**. The license agreement must genuinely refer to your application. The name must exactly match what you specified in point 1. Pay close attention to this if you are using one template for multiple solutions or if you plan to change the app's name.
- **Select only the necessary scopes**. Remember, scopes are not issued "for future use"!
- **Indicate the widget embedding locations of your application**. Don’t hesitate to specify in the description, or better yet, in the chat with the moderator, the embedding locations of the application if you are using the scope "Application Embedding". Ideally, directly in the version card of the application, select the widget embedding locations that are actually used by your solution.
- **Meet the requirements for integrations with external services:**
  - In the description, provide a link to the website of the integrated service;
  - Be sure to include a link to the service's pricing in the description and check the box "User needs to pay for the external service" in the pricing policy of the solution;
  - Send the account details of the service from which your integration can be verified. This can be done either in the solution card in the "Test Data" field or in the chat with the moderator.
- **Thoroughly test the functionality of your solution**. If something doesn’t work, we will return the solution for revision, and the moderation process will be delayed.
