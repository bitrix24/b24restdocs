# CRM Solution Presets

What requirements are placed on CRM presets, how publication occurs, and what to pay attention to during development.

## What is Considered a CRM preset

This is a special type of solution in the Bitrix24 Market catalog, which represents a pre-configured CRM for a specific type of business: configured deal directions, a tailored lead funnel, customized CRM cards, specific business automation using CRM automation rules and workflows, etc.

To create such a solution, it is sufficient to configure the CRM in Bitrix24 using standard user tools and then export these settings using a special built-in tool in the form of an archive. Next, you need to add the application in the Developer's area and attach the obtained archive in the version card of the added application.

Discover what is important for clients, how to approach the design of an industry CRM correctly, and how to stand out in the Bitrix24 Market showcase.

## What CRM Settings Can Be Used in a CRM preset

1. CRM directories;
2. Stages of the lead funnel;
3. Deal directions and stages of directions; 
4. Custom fields for leads, contacts, companies, and deals (except for fields with the type "link to information block");
5. CRM cards for leads, contacts, companies, and deals. For deals, cards linked to specific directions are saved; 
6. Settings for automation rules and triggers in CRM;
7. Workflows related to CRM;
8. Installed REST applications (published in Bitrix24 Market);

## Requirements for Publishing CRM Presets

The target audience for a CRM presets consists of new Bitrix24 users who are not deeply familiar with the product's configuration features. A ready-made, pre-configured CRM will help them start working effectively with Bitrix24. Therefore, the main requirements for CRM presets relate to descriptions and reference information. These descriptions will help potential clients understand whether your CRM preset will be useful to them, so they must be as clear and detailed as possible.

Thus, to successfully pass moderation, your CRM preset (in addition to [meeting standard requirements for solutions](./common-requirements.md)) must have:

1. A brief description indicating the business sector for which the CRM preset is made and mentioning 1-2 of the most important distinguishing scenarios (for example, "Repeat sales and automatic control over salespeople's work");
2. A full description detailing the business sector, distinctive industry scenarios, what specific tasks your CRM preset solves and how (what deal directions are added and why, what fields are present, what scenarios are automated, etc.); what functionality is available at specific Bitrix24 tariff plans;
3. A screenshot of lead stages (if you are using leads) with clear names that directly relate to the type of business for which you created the industry CRM;
4. Screenshots of configured automation rules and workflows in CRM;
5. A screenshot of the slider with the sales funnel (if you are using more than one deal direction);
6. Screenshots of deal stages in each direction with clear names that directly relate to the type of business for which you created the CRM preset;
7. Screenshots of the types of CRM cards with standard and custom fields (for each deal direction, if they differ);
8. Screenshots of tasks assigned to employees in the timeline of the CRM card (if your solution automatically generates tasks for employees) with clear titles related to the type of business for which you created the CRM preset;
9. A list of third-party applications used in the CRM preset;
10. A list of available functionality of the CRM preset depending on the Bitrix24 tariff plan.

Additionally, it is recommended to:

1. Create a training video explaining how to properly use the configured scenarios of the CRM preset. This will help users understand whether to install your solution and will also reduce the load on your technical support. It is advisable to provide a link to the video directly in the description of the CRM preset;
2. Prepare a textual instruction and FAQ for your solution in advance, and provide a link to these materials in the "Full description" and "Support and feedback information" fields.

## What the Moderator Will Pay Attention To

The moderator does not test the quality of your solutions or check the functionality of workflows and CRM automation rules, but we receive user complaints, and if the non-functionality of the stated scenarios is confirmed, we may remove problematic solutions from publication.

In the usual course, the following will be checked:

1. Compliance with [publication requirements](./publication-requirements.md);
2. Quality of screenshots (text on them must be easily readable; optimization that clearly degrades image quality is unacceptable);
3. Correctness of descriptions, presence of typos;
4. Compliance of basic CRM settings with descriptions (deal directions and stages, lead funnel stages, CRM card fields, etc.)
