# How to Develop an Application

Developing an application for publication in Bitrix24 Market consists of several key steps:

1. [Create a record](./how-to-add-app.md) of the future application in the Developer's area. This step is necessary to obtain the client_id/client_secret for further work with the [OAuth 2.0 protocol](../../api-reference/oauth/index.md). In fact, at this point, the application itself may not even exist on your side. You do not need to provide application descriptions at this stage, as your solution is clearly not ready for publication yet.
2. Develop the application code using the current documentation on the required [REST API methods](../../api-reference/index.md), specifics of working with authorization tokens, etc. Use your Bitrix24 for testing or request access to a "sandbox" for development and debugging from moderators via the Developer's area chat.
3. Enter descriptions, images, user agreement data with the end user, and other information about the application in the application card in the Developer's area. Sign the [necessary aggrements](../agreements.md) and submit the solution for moderation.
