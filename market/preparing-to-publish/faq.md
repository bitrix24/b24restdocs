# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about Publishing Solutions in Bitrix24 Market

How does the publication process work, what should you pay attention to, and what opportunities are available in the Developer's area?

**WHAT IS ALLOWED AND WHAT IS NOT?**  
Find out in advance [what the moderator will pay attention to](publication-requirements.md) when reviewing your solutions. The more thoroughly you familiarize yourself with this document, the faster and easier your review by the moderator will be.

**WHERE TO FIND CLIENT_ID AND CLIENT_SECRET OF THE APPLICATION?**  
You can find these keys after adding the application in the Developer's area by opening the solution card and clicking the Test button.

**WHEN ADDING AN APPLICATION, AN ERROR "THE SPECIFIED URL IS UNAVAILABLE" APPEARS**  
We send a head request to the specified URL, expecting a response of 200, 301, or 302. If we receive anything other than these, we write "The specified URL is unavailable." You can check this on the site reqbin.com.

**WHY IS MY ALREADY PUBLISHED SOLUTION IN THE "PREPARING FOR MODERATION" STAGE?**  
Any changes made to the solution card (descriptions, pricing policies, etc.) after successful moderation automatically change the status. The current modified information is not visible to users in the public application catalogâ€”they still see and access the solution in the form it was moderated. You can make changes until you decide to publish them. To do this, you need to submit the changes for moderation.

**HOW TO ASK A QUESTION TO THE MODERATOR?**  
Correspondence with the moderator takes place in the chat in the lower right part of the account.

**HOW QUICKLY DOES MODERATION OCCUR?**  
Typically, we review moderation requests within 2-3 business days, but ultimately it depends on the current queue, as requests come in very unevenly.

**WHY CAN'T I MAKE CHANGES TO THE CARD AFTER SUBMITTING FOR MODERATION?**  
Once you have submitted changes to the solution card for moderation, the solution card becomes available for viewing only. It is possible that one of the moderators is currently reviewing your solution, and any edits from your side at this moment would make that review pointless. If, after submitting the solution for moderation, you discover minor issues that you want to quickly fix, message the moderator in the chat requesting to cancel the moderation. After making the corrections, submit the solution for moderation again.

**CHANGING THE APPLICATION CODE**  
After passing moderation, changing the application code is not possible.

**NFR LICENSES**  
To obtain an NFR license, you must have at least one published solution. If you have published solutions, to issue an NFR, you need to write in the chat with the moderator and specify: your partner ID, the account address, and if the license is needed for an industry solution, please also provide the solution code. Within 1-2 business days, NFR will be activated on the specified account. Please note that the NFR license is issued for a period of 6 months, and after this period, you can request it again.
