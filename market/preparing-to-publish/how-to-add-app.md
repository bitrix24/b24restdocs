# How to Add a Solution in the Developer's Area

## Adding an Application

Select the publication region for the solution and fill in the technical specifications: application type, system sections it interacts with, provide links to the solution, or upload an archive containing it.

You can also specify catalog categories, sales terms, and fill in descriptions. 

You may postpone filling out the application card until the submission stage for moderation for publication in Bitrix24 Market.



## Testing Functionality

In the solution card, click the "Test" button. Here you will find [authorization keys](../../api-reference/oauth/index.md) (`client_id` and `secret_id`) and can specify the address of the Bitrix24 account for testing. A new tab will open with your account displaying the solution card in the Market and a "Install" button.

You must independently test the main user scenarios, including installation, uninstallation, and reinstallation of the solution.



## Signing agreements

Before submitting the finished and tested solution for moderation, you will need to enter into agreements with the Bitrix24 company.

To do this, go to the main page and navigate to the ["Sales Settings"](https://vendors.bitrix24.com/sale/) section, select the publication region, sales terms, and add the legal entity (developer information).

For free placement, it is sufficient to agree to the Marketplace Policy of the general terms of use for the partner catalog of solutions. 

In the upper right corner, by clicking the "Instructions" button, you can find explanations for filling out this section and requirements for legal entities.



## Publishing the Solution

Check the compliance of your solution with the [publication regulations](./common-requirements.md) and [formatting requirements](./publication-requirements.md). We highly recommend verifying the application against our [checklist](./checklist.md).

If everything is in order, go to your applications list and click the "Submit For Moderation" button. If the button is not available, it means the card is not fully completed.

In case of any errors in filling out the information in the solution card, you will receive automatic explanations when submitting for moderation. If necessary, contact the moderator via chat.

Moderation takes 1-3 business days. In case of discrepancies, the moderator will return the solution for revision with comments, which you can find in the chat in the upper right corner of the account. After making corrections, resubmit the solution for moderation.

Upon successful moderation, you will receive a notification in the chat with the moderator. The solution will immediately become available in the catalog, but indexing for search occurs once a day.
