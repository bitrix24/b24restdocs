# Overview of Mass-Market Applications

The key difference between a mass-market solution and a custom local integration is that a mass-market application can be used across multiple Bitrix24 accounts simultaneously. Therefore, in such an application, it is no longer possible to use simple [incoming or outgoing webhooks](../local-integrations/local-webhooks.md), which we discussed earlier.

For mass-market solutions, it is important to understand how the [OAuth 2.0](../settings/oauth/index.md) authorization protocol works.

To host your solutions in the Bitrix24 Marketplace, you will need to become a [technology partner](technology-partnership.md) of Bitrix24 or already be a participant in the 1C-Bitrix partner program to gain access to the Developer's area.

In the Developer's area, you will be able to publish solutions such as:

- data migrators to Bitrix24 from other systems
- integrations with telephony services
- integrations with payment systems
- integrations with SMS providers
- as well as business applications to extend the functionality of Bitrix24
