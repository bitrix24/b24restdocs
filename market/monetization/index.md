# Participation Conditions for the Bitrix24 Market Plus Subscription

The primary monetization method for Bitrix24 Market solutions is participation in the [Bitrix24 Market Plus](https://www.bitrix24.com/apps/?category=subscription) subscription.

The client pays a fixed fee for Bitrix24 Market Plus for their Bitrix24 plan and gains the ability to install any solutions included in Bitrix24 Market Plus.

1C-Bitrix distributes the revenue, after deducting its commission, among the solutions that the client has installed and is using on their Bitrix24. [Learn more](subscription-details.md) about how this works.

It is important to understand that in this model, you will not be able to predict the revenue from each individual client in advance, as it will depend on both the client's plan and which other applications they will be using. However, this drawback is more than compensated by the increase in the number of clients, as it is much easier for them to make a purchasing decision, as well as the growth in the overall average transaction value, since applications are primarily purchased by users on higher-tier Bitrix24 plans.

An application participating in the subscription may contain some additional options or extended functionality available for [additional payment](in-app-purchases.md).

However, we want to draw your attention to the fact that a client who has purchased Bitrix24 Market Plus has effectively already paid for the use of your application. For them, it is no longer free!

Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider what can be included as additional paid options and what should remain in the core functionality. Do not turn the core functionality into a "demo version," hoping to generate primary revenue through the sale of additional options. Such an approach is likely to lead to negative feedback from users.
