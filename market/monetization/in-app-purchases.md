# Conditions for Accepting External Payments

You can independently accept payments from clients for additional functionality of your application. Currently, 1C-Bitrix does not charge a fee for such payments.

The mechanism for limiting the duration of your application, as well as enabling and disabling any functionality based on payment, is entirely your responsibility.

You must specify the terms and cost of the additional functionality of your solution in the detail form.
