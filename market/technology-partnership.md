# Technological Partnership

A technological partnership is essential for developers who are not participants in the regular [Bitrix24 partner program](https://partners.bitrix24.com), do not sell licenses for 1C-Bitrix software products, and simply want to showcase their solutions and integrations in the Bitrix24 Market.

Becoming a technological partner to list your solutions in Bitrix24 Market is quite straightforward.

Visit the [Developer's area](https://vendors.bitrix24.com/) and fill out the application form you see there:

- **First and Last Name** – these fields are needed to create a user account that will be linked to your partner account;
- **E-mail** – this value will be used as your login for the partner account (you can later add additional users), as well as for sending automatic notifications (about the moderation status of your solutions, publication, etc.);
- **Phone** – necessary for quick communication with you in case the e-mail is unavailable for any reason;
- **Partner Code** – a symbolic code that will be used for further generation of codes for your modules and solutions. For example, if you open the page of the [application for integration with Miro](https://www.bitrix24.com/apps/app/integrations24.miro/) developed by Bitrix in the Market, you will see that very symbolic code of the application in the browser's address bar. The prefix used here is "integrations24". Once you add at least one solution for Bitrix24 Market, you will not be able to change this prefix, so choose it carefully.
- **Company Name, Company Website** – please fill out these fields to provide information about yourself to the moderators reviewing your application for technological partnership;
- **Comment** – in this field, it is advisable to describe what solutions you plan to publish after obtaining the status of "technological partner."

You just need to agree to the terms of personal data processing and click the "Submit" button.

After that, you will be automatically logged into the Developer's area. It is recommended to immediately go to your user profile and change the password for further work with the account.
