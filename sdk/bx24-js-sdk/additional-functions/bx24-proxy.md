```js
Function BX24.proxy(Function func, Object thisObject)
```

The function `BX24.proxy` is similar to BX.proxy. It is analogous to jQuery.proxy, with one difference: when the function is called again with the same parameters, it will return a reference to the same proxy function that was the result of the first call, rather than a new proxy function.
