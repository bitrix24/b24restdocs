# Drive: Overview of Methods

Drive is a tool for working with files. It allows you to:

- store company documents and personal files
- upload, edit documents, and view change history
- configure access permissions for files and folders
- share files via public links with external users
- synchronize files with your computer

Drive is integrated with Tasks, Chats, CRM, Workgroups, and other Bitrix24 tools. This simplifies work by providing quick access to files, collaborative work on them, and automating document flow.

## Drive Storage

There are three types of storage:

- personal user storage
- company shared storage
- workgroup storage

Storage can be managed using the group of methods [disk.storage.*](./storage/index.md).

## Working with Folders and Files

Folders and files can be created, moved, deleted, and their access permissions can be modified. Use the groups of methods [disk.folder.*](./folder/index.md) and [disk.file.*](./file/index.md) for this.

You can find out the version of a file using the method [disk.version.get](./version/disk-version-get.md).

## Drive Connection with Other Objects

**CRM.** Files can be attached to activities and estimates. The group of methods [crm.activity.*](../crm/timeline/activities/index.md) is responsible for working with activities, while [crm.quote.*](../crm/quote/crm-quote-add.md) handles estimates.

**Workflows.** You can initiate workflows for documents in the shared drive. Workflow management is performed using the methods [bizproc.workflow.*](../bizproc/index.md).

**Tasks.** Files are attached to task descriptions and comments. All task participants can view, edit, and download attached files. Work with tasks and comments should be done through the groups of methods [tasks.task.*](../tasks/index.md) and [task.commentitem.*](../tasks/comment-item/index.md).

**Calendar.** Files are added to events and become accessible to all participants. You can create and modify events using the methods [calendar.event.*](../calendar/index.md).

**News Feed.** Files are attached to messages and comments. The method [log.blogpost.add](../log/log-blogpost-add.md) creates a new message, while the method [log.blogcomment.add](../log/log-blogcomment-add.md) creates a new comment.

**Email.** Attachments from emails are saved to Drive. Emails can only be managed through the Bitrix24 interface. If an email is saved in CRM, attachments can be interacted with using the methods [crm.activity.*](../crm/timeline/activities/index.md) through the `FILES` field.

**Workgroups and Projects.** Drive is integrated [into workgroups and projects](../sonet-group/sonet-group-create.md), with a separate storage for each.

**Universal Lists.** List items are linked to Drive through the [field](../lists/fields/index.md) of type File (Drive). You can create and modify an item using the methods [lists.element.*](../lists/elements/index.md).

**Chats.** Users can exchange documents, photos, videos, and audio. Files can be viewed and downloaded, and documents can be edited in the chat without downloading. Attached files are accessible to all chat participants. The method [im.message.add](../chats/messages/im-message-add.md) sends a message with a file in the chat.
