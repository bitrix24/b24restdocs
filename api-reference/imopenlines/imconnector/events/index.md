This event indicates a new message from OL. The event is triggered for full-fledged connectors, such as Telegram or VKontakte. It does not work with the [widget or online chat](*widget_key), which are more like js-applications.

It is essential to call the method [**imconnector.send.status.delivery**](../imconnector-send-status-delivery.md) in response; otherwise, the message will be marked as undelivered in the messenger.

## Parameters

#|
|| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Since version** ||
|| **CONNECTOR** | Connector ID (this is used to check if the event belongs to the verifier). | ||
|| **LINE** | ID of the open line. | ||
|| **MESSAGES** | An array of messages, where each message is described by an array of the following format:


```json
{
"im": {
    "chat_id": 845,
    "message_id": 344029
},
"message": {
    "text": "Sergey \"Pokoev\":\n Test message"
},
"chat": {
    "id": "2"
}
}
```
