The `onAppUnistall` event is triggered when an application is uninstalled.

## Event Parameters:

#|
|| **Parameter** | **Description** ||
|| **CLEAN=1/0**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | The value of the "clear application data" flag set by the user when uninstalling the application. ||
|| **application_token**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | The secret identifier (see [{#T}](../../events/safe-event-handlers.md)). ||
|#

{% note warning %}

When an application is uninstalled, all access permissions for the application to the REST API are revoked. Therefore, even though the event handler will receive authorization data, it can no longer use the API on behalf of the uninstalled application.
