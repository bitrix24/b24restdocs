- **L** (Local) - local application;

|| **DAYS** | Number of days remaining until the end of the paid period or trial period. ||

After the paid period expires, the application will continue to operate during the grace period allowed for potential payment delays, after which it will automatically switch to demo mode or be blocked. At this point, the value of the PAYMENT_EXPIRED flag will be Y, and the DAYS field will contain a negative number.
