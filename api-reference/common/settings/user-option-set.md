{% note warning "We are still updating this page" %}

Some data may be missing here â€” we will fill it in shortly.

{% if build == 'dev' %}

{% note alert "TO-DO _not deployed to prod_" %}

See [user.option.*](./user-option.md). It briefly describes both get and set.
It seems we need to split and provide separate descriptions.

- parameters or fields are missing
- parameter types are not specified
- parameter requirements are not indicated
- examples are missing
- success response is absent
- error response is absent
- links to pages that have not yet been created are not provided
