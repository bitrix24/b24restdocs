{% include notitle [Scope telephony all](./_includes/scope-telephony-all.md) %}

The method `telephony.externalcall.register` registers a call in Bitrix24 by searching for the corresponding object in CRM based on the phone number. If found, it adds the call linked to the identified object. If not found, it can automatically create a lead.

When using `telephony.externalcall.register`, the first responsible person for this client will be automatically assigned as the responsible for the new lead. This responsible person can be changed later through [telephony.externalcall.finish](telephony-external-call-finish.md).

Simultaneously with the call registration, the method can optionally display the call card to the user. The user to whom the card is shown is identified either by `USER_ID` or `USER_PHONE_INNER`. (That is, the fields are marked as required, but in fact, only one of the two is needed.)

There is no need to call this method again for calls received on the event [OnExternalCallStart](./events/on-external-call-start.md). These calls are already registered in the system, and only [telephony.externalcall.finish](telephony-external-call-finish.md) should be called at the end of the call.

{% note warning %}

A repeated call to `telephony.externalcall.register` with the same parameters, without closing the previous call using the method `telephony.externalcall.finish`, will return the same `CALL_ID` within 30 minutes.

{% endnote %}

To create an activity "call," it is also necessary to call the method `telephony.externalcall.finish`.

{% note warning %}

Values from this parameter are used in Bitrix24's Sales Intelligence scenarios. Therefore, integration solutions with telephony for the Applications24 catalog must necessarily pass the number to which the registered incoming call was made.

[*mode]: There are:
- simple mode (without leads) - in which a deal will be created instead of a lead;
- repeat sales mode, in which a deal/lead will be created even if the entity is found in CRM. (But it will not be created if there is an active deal/lead or the number is on the CRM blacklist).
