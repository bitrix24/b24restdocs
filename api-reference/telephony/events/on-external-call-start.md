The `OnExternalCallStart` event is triggered when a user clicks on a phone number in CRM entities to make an outgoing call.

To ensure the event is triggered, go to Telephony > Telephony Settings and select your application in the **Default outgoing call number** field.

Alternatively, you can set this application as the default number in the user settings. The event will only trigger for the selected application.

{% note info "" %}

Events will not be sent to the application until the installation is complete. [Check the application installation](../../../settings/app-installation/installation-finish.md)
