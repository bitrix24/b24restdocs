New vendors are CRM entities. The mechanism for linking entities to inventory documents is used. Vendors are relevant only for incoming documents.

The service can only be used when working with vendors through CRM. Multiple vendor contacts (CRM entity Contact) can be attached to one incoming document, but no more than one vendor company (CRM entity Company).

The service is available starting from version **catalog 23.0.0** and **rest 23.100.0**.
