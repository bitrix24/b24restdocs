## Completing the Request for Additional Information Task via REST

Starting from version **20.0.800** of the Business Processes module, it became possible to complete **Request for Additional Information** tasks via the REST method **bizproc.task.complete**.

To understand which fields need to be filled out, a new property `Fields` has been added to the PARAMETERS in the method [bizproc.task.list](./bizproc-task-list.md) - an array describing the fields.

```json
"PARAMETERS": {
    "CommentLabel": "Comment",
    "CommentRequired": "N",
    "ShowComment": "Y",
    "StatusOkLabel": "Save",
    "Fields": [
        {
            "Type": "datetime",
            "Name": "date",
            "Description": "",
            "Multiple": false,
            "Required": true,
            "Options": null,
            "Settings": null,
            "Default": "2020-07-08T15:16:12+02:00",
            "Id": "date"
        }
    ]
}
```

The **default** values are stored in the **Default** section. Values are converted to "external" representation (for dates - in REST ATOM format (ISO-8601), and for files - as a link to the file).

Next, these field values need to be passed to the **bizproc.task.complete** method in the **Fields** parameter. This time, the values are converted to "internal representation" (i.e., dates from REST format are converted to internal format, and files from REST are saved and attached to the business process).
