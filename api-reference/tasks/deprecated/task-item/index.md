{% note info %}

To obtain the tags of a specific task, you need to pass the parameter `/rest/task.item.gettags.xml?TASK_ID=3&auth=18tci5kga6v12g8okzm5r26sv0n9is84`. The request can be either `ID` or `TASK_ID`. It is essential that this parameter is first. The response will return `{"result":["TAG1","TAG2","ETC..."]}`.
