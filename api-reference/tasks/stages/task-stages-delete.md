The method `task.stages.delete` removes a Kanban stage / My Plan. It takes the `id` of the stage as input.

The stage is checked for sufficient access permission, as well as for the absence of tasks within it.

## Parameters

|| **Parameter** / **Type** | **Description** ||
|| **id^*^**
[`integer`](../../data-types.md) | Identifier of the stage to be deleted. ||
|| **isAdmin**
[`boolean`](../../data-types.md) | If set to `true`, permission checks will not occur, provided that the requester is an administrator of the account. ||
|#

Returns `true` if the stage is successfully deleted.
