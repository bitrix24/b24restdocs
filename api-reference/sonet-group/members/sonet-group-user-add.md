This method allows adding users as members of a workgroup without the need for invitations and confirmations. To perform this operation, the current user must have administrator rights in the social network. If an extranet user is added, the group will become accessible in the extranet (if it was not accessible before).

## Call Parameters

#|
|| **Parameter** | **Description** ||
|| **GROUP_ID** | ID of the workgroup. ||
|| **USER_ID** | ID of the user (or array of IDs) being added to the group. ||
|#
