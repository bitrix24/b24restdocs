The method `crm.deal.delete` removes a deal and all associated objects.

Deleting a deal will result in the removal of all related objects, such as tasks, history, Timeline activities, and others. Objects are deleted if they are not linked to other entities or items. If the objects are linked to other entities, only the link to the deleted deal will be removed.
