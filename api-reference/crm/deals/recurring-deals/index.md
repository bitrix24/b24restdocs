## Connection of Recurring Deals with Other CRM Objects

**Deals.** To create a new template, use the method [crm.deal.recurring.add](./crm-deal-recurring-add.md). Pass the ID of an existing deal in the `DEAL_ID` parameter of the method. The field values of this deal will be saved in the template.

To view the deal based on which the template was created, execute the method [crm.deal.recurring.list](./crm-deal-recurring-list.md). As a result, you will receive the value `BASED_ID`. Pass the obtained value to the `id` parameter of the method [crm.deal.get](../crm-deal-get.md). If the template was created in the recurring deals section of Bitrix24, the `BASED_ID` parameter will be empty.

**Funnels.** You can create and manage sales funnels for deals through the group of methods [crm.category.*](../../universal/category/index.md) where `entityTypeId` of the deal = `2`. To create a recurring deal in the desired funnel, pass the funnel ID in the `CATEGORY_ID` parameter.

**Products.** If the deal template includes product items, a new recurring deal will be created with them. To modify the product items in the template, use the methods from the group [crm.item.productrow.*](../../universal/product-rows/index.md). Pass the `DEAL_ID` value from the result of the method [crm.deal.recurring.list](./crm-deal-recurring-list.md) as the `ownerId` of the deal.

**Clients.** If a company and contacts are selected in the deal template, a new recurring deal will be created with them. To change the company in the template, use the method [crm.deal.update](../crm-deal-update.md), and to change the contacts â€” the methods from the group [crm.deal.contact.*](../contacts/crm-deal-contact-add.md). Pass the `DEAL_ID` value from the result of the method [crm.deal.recurring.list](./crm-deal-recurring-list.md) as the `id` of the deal.
