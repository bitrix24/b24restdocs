# Contacts in CRM: Overview of Methods

A contact is a CRM object that stores data about clientsâ€”individuals. The contact card contains phone numbers, email addresses, and messenger identifiers in a special format that allows communication with the client directly through Bitrix.

## Contact Connection with Other CRM Objects

**Deal, lead, SPA.** Any CRM object that has the standard field `Client` is connected to contacts. The connection is managed through groups of methods for [deals](../deals/index.md), [leads](../leads/index.md), and [SPAs](../universal/index.md). 

**Company.** A single contact can be linked to multiple companies. This connection is managed using the group of methods [crm.contact.company.*](./company/index.md). When you select a company in the `Client` field in deals or SPAs, all associated contacts are automatically pulled into the field. 

**Requisites.** The requisites themselves are a separate object, and methods from the group [crm.requisite.*](../requisites/index.md) and [crm.address.*](../requisites/addresses/index.md) are used to create or modify them. They are displayed in the `Requisites` field of the contact card.

## Contact Card

The main workspace in a contact is the General tab of its card. It consists of two parts: 

* The left part contains fields with information. If the system fields are insufficient, you can create your own custom fields. They allow you to store information in various data formats: string, number, link, address, and others. The group of methods [crm.contact.userfield.*](./userfield/index.md) is used to create, modify, retrieve, or delete custom contact fields.

* The right part contains the contact's timeline. In it, you can create, edit, filter, and delete CRM activities using the group of methods [crm.activity.*](../timeline/activities/index.md), and timeline records using the group of methods [crm.timeline.*](../timeline/index.md).

You can manage the parameters of the contact card through the group of methods [crm.contact.details.configuration.*](./custom-form/index.md).

## Widgets

You can embed an application into the contact card. Thanks to embedding, you can use the application without leaving the contact card.

There are two embedding scenarios:

* Use special [embedding spots](../../widgets/crm/index.md). For example, by creating your own tab.
* Create a [custom field](../../../tutorials/crm/crm-widgets/widget-as-field-in-lead-page.md) that will load the interface of your application.
