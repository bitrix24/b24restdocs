# Event onCrmInvoiceSetStatus for Invoice Status Change

{% note tip "" %}

Choose a tool for developing with an AI agent:

- use [Alaio Vibecode](../../../../../ai-tools/vibecode.md) to build an app for Bitrix24 from a task description without knowing any programming language. The agent writes the code and deploys the app to a server, with no manual hosting setup
- use the [MCP server](../../../../../ai-tools/mcp.md) to develop a REST API integration in your own project. The agent refers to the official REST documentation

{% endnote %}

This event is triggered when the status of an invoice is changed.
