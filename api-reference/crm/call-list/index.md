# Call List: Overview of Methods

A call list is a CRM activity from which multiple clients can be called consecutively. An employee works with a single activity that contains selected contacts or companies. The results of the calls will be automatically saved in the client cards:
- in the attached call activity and its comments,
- in the filled CRM form and fields of the card,
- in the deal or invoice created from the call list.

## Connection with Other Objects

**Contact**. To call multiple contacts, specify an array of `ID` contacts in the [creation](./crm-calllist-add.md) or [update](./crm-calllist-update.md) method of the call list. You can obtain the `ID` of contacts using the [crm.item.list](../../crm/universal/crm-item-list.md) method with the parameter `entityTypeId = 3`.

**Company**. To call multiple companies, specify an array of `ID` companies in the [creation](./crm-calllist-add.md) or [update](./crm-calllist-update.md) method of the call list. You can obtain the `ID` of companies using the [crm.item.list](../../crm/universal/crm-item-list.md) method with the parameter `entityTypeId = 4`.

**CRM Form**. During the call, the employee can fill in information about the client in the CRM form attached to the call list. After the call is completed, the form will be available in the client card, and the information from the form will be saved in the fields of the card. To attach a form to the call list, specify its `ID` in the [creation](./crm-calllist-add.md) or [update](./crm-calllist-update.md) method of the call list. The `ID` of the form can be found in the list of forms in Bitrix24 at `https://your-domain.com/crm/webform/`.

**Directory**. The status of the call in the call list card is an element of the [directory](../status/index.md). To change the statuses of the call list, use the directory methods [crm.status.*](../status/index.md) with the parameter `ENTITY_ID = CALL_LIST`.

**User**. The call list is linked to a user by a numeric identifier in the `createdBy` field â€” who created it. You can obtain user data by identifier using the [user.get](../../user/user-get.md) method.

## How to Delete a Call List

There is no method for deleting a call list among the call list methods. You can delete a call list by deleting the activity using the [crm.activity.delete](../timeline/activities/activity-base/crm-activity-delete.md) method.

1. Use the [crm.activity.list](../timeline/activities/activity-base/crm-activity-list.md) method with a filter by the activity name `SUBJECT`. In the field value, specify `Call #ID`. Replace `ID` with the `ID` of the call list obtained from the [crm.calllist.add](./crm-calllist-add) or [crm.calllist.list](./crm-calllist-list) methods.

2. Pass the `ID` of the activity from the result to the deletion method [crm.activity.delete](../timeline/activities/activity-base/crm-activity-delete.md).

- JS

    ```js
    // callListMethod is recommended when you need to get the entire set of list data and the volume of records is relatively small (up to about 1000 items). The method loads all data at once, which can lead to high memory load when working with large volumes.
    
    try {
      const response = await $b24.callListMethod(
        'crm.activity.list',
        {

    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Request failed', error)
    }
    
    // fetchListMethod is preferable when working with large datasets. The method implements iterative fetching using a generator, allowing data to be processed in parts and efficiently using memory.
    
    try {
      const generator = $b24.fetchListMethod('crm.activity.list', {
        filter: {
          "SUBJECT": "Call #13",
        },
        select: ["ID"]
      }, 'ID')
    
      for await (const page of generator) {
        if (page.length === 0) {
          console.log("No activities found with the name 'Call #13'.");
          return;

    }
    
    // callMethod provides manual control over the process of paginated data retrieval through the start parameter. It is suitable for scenarios where precise control over request batches is required. However, it may be less efficient compared to fetchListMethod when dealing with large volumes of data.
    
    try {
      const response = await $b24.callMethod('crm.activity.list', {
        filter: {
          "SUBJECT": "Call #13",
