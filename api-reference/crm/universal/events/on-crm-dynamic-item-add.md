Although [universal CRM methods](../index.md) allow adding and modifying objects of standard types such as deals, leads, contacts, companies, and estimates, the `onCrmDynamicItemAdd` event will not trigger when adding the listed objects.

To track new deals, leads, and so on, you can use specific events:

- [{#T}](../../deals/events/on-crm-deal-add.md)
- [{#T}](../../leads/events/on-crm-lead-add.md)
- [{#T}](../../contacts/events/on-crm-contact-add.md)
- [{#T}](../../companies/events/on-crm-company-add.md)
- [{#T}](../../quote/events/on-crm-quote-add.md)

The `onCrmDynamicItemAdd` event will trigger when new invoices are added.
