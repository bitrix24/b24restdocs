Although [universal CRM methods](../index.md) allow adding and modifying objects of standard types such as deals, leads, contacts, companies, and estimates, the event `onCrmDynamicItemDelete` will not trigger when deleting the listed objects.

To track deleted deals, leads, etc., you can use special events:

- [{#T}](../../deals/events/on-crm-deal-delete.md)
- [{#T}](../../leads/events/on-crm-lead-delete.md)
- [{#T}](../../contacts/events/on-crm-contact-delete.md)
- [{#T}](../../companies/events/on-crm-company-delete.md)
- [{#T}](../../quote/events/on-crm-quote-delete.md)

When deleting new invoices, the event `onCrmDynamicItemDelete` will trigger.
