# Digital Workspaces

Digital workspaces are a separate section for smart processes that are not tied to CRM. A workspace can consist of one or more processes. Each has its own cards, funnels, kanban stages, Automation rules, and other features.

On the account, you can find them in the section *Automation > Digital Workspaces > List of Digital Workspaces*.
