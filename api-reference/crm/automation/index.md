Triggers are a tool for CRM automation. Unlike Automation rules, triggers do not perform operations. Instead, they can monitor client actions and certain changes within the CRM. Triggers in CRM are available for leads, deals, estimates, invoices, and SPAs. For more details, refer to the article [Triggers in CRM](https://helpdesk.bitrix24.com/open/16628872/).
