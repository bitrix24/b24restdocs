Universal deals are a type of deal with advanced settings. In the universal deal detail form, you can sync the deal with the calendar, select a meeting location with the client, add colleagues, choose a client from the CRM entity, categorize deals by color, and select a conference room. Some advanced settings are available to the employee on the Bitrix24 side.
