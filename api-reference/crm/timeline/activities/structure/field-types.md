## textWithTranslation

Text with translation support.

Fields marked with the type *textWithTranslation* support multilingualism. In a simple case, it is enough to pass a string into them. This string will be used as the value.

If support for different interface languages is required, a non-empty array can be passed as the field value, where the keys are the language codes and the values are the text in that language, for example:

```json
{
    "en": "Save"
}
```

If a translation for the current language is not found, English will be used. If English is also not found, the first element of the array will be used.
