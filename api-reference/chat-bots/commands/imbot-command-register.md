    Array(

        'TITLE' => 'Get echo message',
        'PARAMS' => 'some text'
    )

|| **EVENT_COMMAND_ADD**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | `'http://www.hazz/chatApi/bot.php'` | Link to the handler for commands | ||
|#

{% include [Parameter Notes](../../../_includes/required.md) %}

{% note warning %}

To process the command, the application must handle the command addition event [ONIMCOMMANDADD](./events/index.md).

{% endnote %}

{% note warning %}

Attention! If you plan to install more than one command for the chat bot: Bitrix24 Rest imposes a restriction on working with event handlers - there can only be one handler per application. Therefore, when registering a second command, the links to the handlers `EVENT_COMMAND_ADD` must be the same as for the first command.

If it is necessary to handle multiple commands within one application, this must be accounted for within the event handler. For this, an array of commands is passed when the event occurs, so they can be processed correctly.

{% endnote %}

{% note warning %}

It is mandatory to specify the array of translations `LANG` for at least RU and EN. If there is no phrase for BY, UA, KZ, the RU phrases will be shown by default; if there is no phrase in RU, the command will be hidden. The same applies to other languages - if there are no phrases, the EN phrases will be shown by default; if there is no phrase in EN, the command will be hidden in the public part.
