{% include [Notes on parameters](../../../_includes/required.md) %}

{% note warning %}

To process the command, the application must handle the event of adding a command [ONIMCOMMANDADD](./events/index.md).

{% endnote %}

{% note warning %}

Attention! If you plan to install more than one command for the chat bot: Bitrix24 Rest imposes a limitation on working with event handlers - there can only be one handler per application. Therefore, when registering a second command, the links to the handlers `EVENT_COMMAND_ADD` must be the same as those of the first command.

If it is necessary to handle multiple commands within one application, this must be accounted for within the event handler. For this, when the event occurs, an array of commands is passed to allow for correct processing.

{% endnote %}

{% note warning %}

It is mandatory to specify the array of translations `LANG` for at least DE and EN. If there is no phrase for BY, UA, KZ, the phrases from DE will be shown by default; if there is no phrase in DE, the command will be hidden. The same applies to other languages - if there are no phrases, the phrases from EN will be shown by default; if there is no phrase in EN, the command will be hidden in the public part.
