Please note! To process the command, the application must handle the event of adding a command [ONIMCOMMANDADD](./events/on-im-command-add.md).

## Global

They work in any dialogue or chat. An example of such a command (`COMMON = Y`):

```
/giphy image
```

Calling it in any chat will generate a response from the chatbot, even in a chat where the chatbot is not a member.

## Local

They work only in direct messages with the chatbot and in group chats where it is a participant. An example of such a command (`COMMON = N`):

```
/help
```

Calling it in the [EchoBot](https://github.com/bitrix24com/bots) (**bot.php**) will display a list of available commands.
