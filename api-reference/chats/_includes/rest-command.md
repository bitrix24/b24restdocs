{% note info %}

This example uses the `restCommand` function. This is a method for sending data to *Bitrix24*. You can use your own function to call the method, the JavaScript method [BX24.callMethod](../../bx24-js-sdk/how-to-call-rest-methods/bx24-call-method.md) or industry standard [B24PhpSDK](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk).
