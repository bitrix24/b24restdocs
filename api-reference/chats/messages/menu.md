The context menu allows the user to interact with the chatbot or chat application from the message context menu.

## How to Add Your Items to the Context Menu

The context menu is part of the message; when creating a message, you need to add the key `MENU` and pass the parameters.

Methods that support the context menu:
- [imbot.message.add](../../chat-bots/messages/imbot-message-add.md) - sending a message from the chatbot.
- [imbot.message.update](../../chat-bots/messages/imbot-message-update.md) - sending a message update from the chatbot.
- [imbot.command.answer](../../chat-bots/commands/imbot-command-answer.md) - publishing a response to a command.
- [im.message.add](./im-message-add.md) - sending a message in chat.
- [im.message.update](./im-message-update.md) - sending a message update from the chatbot.

Let's consider this message as an example:

{% include [Explanation about restCommand](../_includes/rest-command.md) %}

```php
restCommand(
    'im.message.add',
    Array(
        "DIALOG_ID" => 12,
        "MESSAGE" => "Hello! Message with context menu!",
        "MENU" => Array(
            Array(
                "TEXT" => "Bitrix24",
                "LINK" => "http://bitrix24.com",
            ),
            Array(
                "TEXT" => "Echo",
                "COMMAND" => "echo",
                "COMMAND_PARAMS" => "test from keyboard"
            ),
            Array(
                "TEXT" => "Open app",
                "APP_ID" => "12",
                "APP_PARAMS" => "TEST"
            ),
        )
    ),
    $_REQUEST["auth"]
);
```

The context menu is a set of buttons, each button can consist of the following keys:

- **TEXT** - button text;
- **LINK** - link;
- **COMMAND** - command that will be sent to the bot;
- **COMMAND_PARAMS** - parameters for the command;
- **APP_ID** - identifier of the installed chat application.
- **APP_PARAMS** - parameters for launching the chat application.
- **DISABLED** - if set to `Y`, this button will not be clickable.
- **ACTION** - action, can be one of the following types ([REST revision 28](../../chat-bots/im-revision-get.md)):
  - **PUT** - insert into the input field.
  - **SEND** - send text.
  - **COPY** - copy text to clipboard.
  - **CALL** - make a call.
  - **DIALOG** - open the specified dialog.
- **ACTION_VALUE** - value, which means different things for each type ([REST revision 28](../../chat-bots/im-revision-get.md)):
  - **PUT** - text that will be inserted into the input field.
  - **SEND** - text that will be sent.
  - **COPY** - text that will be copied to the clipboard.
  - **CALL** - phone number in international format.
  - **DIALOG** - dialog identifier, which can be a `USER ID` or a `CHAT ID` in the format `chatXXX`.

The required fields are **TEXT** and either the **LINK** field or the **COMMAND** field.

If the **LINK** key is specified, the button becomes an external link. If the **COMMAND** and **COMMAND_PARAMS** fields are specified, the button acts as an action and sends a command to the chatbot without publishing it in the chat. Available since version 26 of the [API revision (platform version)](../../chat-bots/im-revision-get.md).

If the **APP_ID** and **APP_PARAMS** fields are specified, the button will open a window with the chat application.

If you need to create two rows of buttons in a row, you need to add a button with the following content to separate them: `"TYPE" => "NEWLINE"`.

## Handling Commands by the Chatbot

To handle button presses and menu items, **commands** are used.

1. To ensure that the command works on the keyboard (and not only), it must first be registered through the method [imbot.command.register](../../chat-bots/commands/imbot-command-register.md) (to make the command available only for the keyboard, it must be created with the key `"HIDDEN" => "Y"`).

    In the button, the following keys are specified:

    ```php
    "COMMAND" => "page", // command that will be sent to the chatbot
    "COMMAND_PARAMS" => "1", // parameters for the command
    ```

2. Pressing the button will create an event [ONIMCOMMANDADD](../../chat-bots/commands/events/index.md).

3. Inside this event, you need to either create a new message or edit an old one (thus creating the effect of pagination).

4. Inside the event, the **[data][COMMAND]** array will contain data about the triggered event. It includes the value **COMMAND_CONTEXT** - a special key that describes the context in which the command was triggered:
   - if the command was written by the user themselves, it will be **TEXTAREA**;
   - if the command came from the keyboard, it will be **KEYBOARD**;
   - if the command came from the context menu, it will be **MENU**.

## Handling the Opening of the Chat Application

Chat applications launched from the context menu operate on the principles of [Context Application](../outdated/context.md).
