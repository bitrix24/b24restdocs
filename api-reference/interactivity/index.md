# Interactive Applications

By connecting to RT servers, you can:

- create a truly interactive application
- change states
- instantly update the interface without the need to refresh the page in real-time

If you are building your own client, check out the [Working with Push & Pull server](./custom-push-and-pull-client.md). If you only need to add interactivity to an existing application, read about [Working with Push & Pull in the browser](./push-and-pull-in-browser.md).

Interactivity in applications is available out of the box starting from the [version](../cloud-and-on-premise/on-premise/versions.md) Push & Pull 18.5.500.

Learn more about interactivity in applications in the training course [REST API Bitrix24](https://dev.1c-bitrix.com/learning/course/index.php?COURSE_ID=266&LESSON_ID=25560).
