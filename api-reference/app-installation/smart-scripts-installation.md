# Installation of Solutions with "Smart Scenarios"

"Smart scenarios" are a configuration solution based on CRM Automation rules, embedded in deals, leads, companies, and contacts outside of the Sales Funnel. "Smart scenarios" can be saved as a single archive using the custom export functionality of industry settings.

This archive can be uploaded in the Developer's area in the application detail form and published as a ready-made solution in the Bitrix24 Marketplace.

The installation of such an application is carried out by Bitrix24 and occurs in several stages:

1. Automatic downloading of the archive from the Developer's area to the Bitrix24 where the installation takes place;
2. Unpacking the archive;
3. Adding "smart scenarios" to the necessary embedding locations from the archive files to the current Bitrix24.

## Using REST Applications in the Functionality of "Smart Scenarios"

When configuring "smart scenarios" before exporting settings, the solution developer can install and use applications from the Bitrix24 Marketplace to implement the required functionality.

For example, you can utilize non-standard Automation rules that were added from the Marketplace solution. The convenience is that you can focus specifically on the business logic of the scenarios themselves without delving into the complex development of individual Automation rules. At the same time, by using Automation rules from Marketplace solutions, you can offer users of your "smart scenarios" very flexible and highly functional solutions.

The list of used applications is saved in the file with "smart scenarios" during export. Upon import, the applications from this list will be automatically installed on the same Bitrix24 where the application with "smart scenarios" is being installed.

If any of these applications include solutions available to the client only within the "Bitrix24 Marketplace" subscription, then when publishing your "smart scenarios," you will also need to place them in the Bitrix24 Marketplace catalog under the subscription terms.
