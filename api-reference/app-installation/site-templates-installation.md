# Installing Website Templates

A "website template" or "ready-made website" is a configuration solution in the form of a single-page or multi-page website, saved as a single archive using the user functionality for exporting the website.

This archive can be uploaded in the Developer's area in the application cards and published as a ready-made solution in the Bitrix24 Market.

The installation of such an application is carried out by Bitrix24 and occurs in several stages:

1. Automatic downloading of the archive from the Developer's area to the Bitrix24 where the installation takes place;
2. Unpacking the archive;
3. Registration in the repository of custom layout blocks if non-standard blocks are used;
4. Creating website pages from the archive.

## Using REST Applications in the Functionality of Ready-Made Websites

When creating a website before exporting, the solution developer can install and use applications from the Bitrix24 Market that add non-standard layout blocks.

The list of applications whose blocks are used in the exported website is saved in a file with the "website template" during export. Upon import, applications from this list will be automatically installed on the same Bitrix24 where the ready-made website is being installed. The convenience is that you can focus specifically on the business logic of your websites without delving into the complex development of unique design solutions in the blocks.

If among these applications there are also solutions available to the client only within the "Bitrix24 Market Plus" subscription, then when publishing your ready-made website, you will also need to place it in the Bitrix24 Market catalog under the terms of the "Bitrix24 Market Plus" subscription.
