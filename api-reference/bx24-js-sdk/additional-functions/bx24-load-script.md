```js
void BX24.loadScript(Array|String script[, Function callback])
```

The method `BX24.loadScript` loads and executes the client-side javascript file `script`. You can pass an array of files, in which case they will be loaded sequentially. The `callback` handler will be called after all loads are complete.
