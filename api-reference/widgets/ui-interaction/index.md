- information about bx24-js, a link to the section with all methods, a block about useful functions and system dialogs with links to the sections below

This section describes the methods that enable the integration of third-party applications into the Bitrix24 interface. The unique aspect of these methods is that they do not make a physical request to the server but work with the page where the application is embedded. Data exchange occurs via `postMessage`.
