The `CallCardSetMute` method allows the application to disable the operator's microphone.

The application must pass an object to the method with the property muted, which contains a boolean value: true - the microphone should be off, false - on. No data is passed to the callback function.

## Example

```js
BX24.placement.bindEvent('BackgroundCallCard::initialized', event => {
    BX24.placement.call('CallCardSetMute', { muted: true }, () => {
// some code
    });
});
```
