The `CallCardSetUiState` method allows the application to change the state of the call card interface.

The application must pass an object with the property uiState to the method, where the value should be one of those obtained from the getListUiStates method. No data is passed to the callback function.

## Example

```js
BX24.placement.bindEvent('BackgroundCallCard::initialized', event => {
    BX24.placement.call('CallCardSetUiState', {uiState: 'connected'}, () => {
        // some code 
    })
});
```
