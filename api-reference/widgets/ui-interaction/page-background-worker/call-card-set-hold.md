The `CallCardSetHold` method allows the application to place a call on hold.

The application must pass an object with the property held to the method, which contains a boolean value: true - to enable hold, false - to disable hold. No data is passed to the callback function.

## Example

```js
BX24.placement.bindEvent('BackgroundCallCard::initialized', event => {
    BX24.placement.call('CallCardSetHold', { held: true }, () => {
        // some code
    });
});
```
