The `CallCardSetCardTitle` method allows you to change the title of the call card from the application.

When called, you need to pass an object with the property title. Nothing is passed to the callback function.

## Example

```js
BX24.placement.bindEvent('BackgroundCallCard::initialized', event => {
    BX24.placement.call('CallCardSetCardTitle', { title: 'hello world!' }, () => {
        // some code
    })
});
```
