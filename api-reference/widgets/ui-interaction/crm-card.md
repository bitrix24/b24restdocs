In the CRM card, an additional command `reloadData` is available, which will refresh the CRM interface data. This command is solely for transmitting data to the CRM card; therefore, until the card is actually saved by the user, the values will not be stored in the database.

```js
BX24.placement.call('reloadData', function(){console.log('reload call')});
```

The js interface is exclusively for sending data to the form. Until the form is saved by the user, the value will not be stored in the database.
