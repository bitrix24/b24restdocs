# Bitrix24 UI Kit: Building Interfaces That Speak the Same Language as the Platform

Creating an interface is not just about choosing buttons and colors. It's about whether the user feels that your application is **part of Bitrix24**, rather than something foreign squeezed into an iframe.

[Bitrix24 UI Kit](https://bitrix24.github.io/b24ui/) is a library of components and design patterns created to:

- make your interfaces look and feel *natural* within the Bitrix24 ecosystem,
- allow you to focus on business logic instead of reinventing the wheel with CSS,
- and ensure that applications—from internal CRM tools to public solutions in the marketplace—remain consistent, predictable, and user-friendly.

If you are developing an application for Bitrix24, you **don’t need** to worry about pixels, margins, and shadows. That’s already been taken care of for you. Instead, you work with ready-made components that are similar to those used by the platform itself.

## What Will Using the UI Kit Give You?

- **Quick Start.** Connect the UI Kit and immediately gain access to buttons, modal windows, forms, tabs, lists, and dozens of other components.
- **Consistency.** Your application will "speak" to the user in the same visual language as the entire Bitrix24.
- **Recognition.** Applications developed using the UI Kit pass moderation faster and are valued higher by users.
- **Reliability.** UI Kit components are constantly used and tested—this means fewer bugs, fewer CSS hacks, and more confidence in the outcome.

## Who Is This For?

- Developers creating internal corporate applications on Bitrix24.  
- Teams working on solutions for the Marketplace.  
- Bitrix24 Partners adapting interfaces to meet client needs.  
- Anyone who wants to write less UI code and achieve more results.
