A set of methods for working with comments in the timeline of entities.

In fact, comments are the same as [timeline entries](../timeline/index.md), but with a different display and the ability for the user to edit them.

Comment data can be retrieved using the method `rpa.timeline.listForItem` â€” this method returns all entries, including comments.
