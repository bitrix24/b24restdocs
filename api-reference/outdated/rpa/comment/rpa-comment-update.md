To upload new files, you must also provide an array with the name and content of the file in base64.

## Example

```json
{
    "typeId": 24,
    "itemId": 10,
    "fields": {
        "description": "Mentioning user with id 1 ",
        "files": [
            {
                "id": 15
            },
            [
                "another_document.pdf", "...base64_decoded_content..."
            ]
        ]
