## Response in case of success

> 200 OK

The response will contain only the main fields of the items, without data about tasks and users of the items:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {},
        {}
    ]
}
```

## Filter Examples

1. **Find items that have incomplete tasks for the current user**

```json
{
    "filter": {
        "tasks": "has_tasks"
    }
}
```

To find items that do not have tasks for the user, you need to pass the value `no_tasks`.

2. **Find items updated by the user with identifier 4**

```json
{
    "filter": {
        "=updatedBy": "4"
    }
}
```

3. **Find items updated or moved by the user with identifier 4**

```json
{
    "filter": {
        "logic": "or",
        "0": {
            "=updatedBy": "4"
        },
        "1": {
            "=movedBy": "4"
        }
    }
}
```

4. **Find items that have a filled custom field with code `UF_RPA_1_STRING`**

```json
{
    "filter": {
        "!=UF_RPA_1_STRING": "",
    }
}
```

5. **Find items that were created, modified, and moved between March 19 and March 22**

```json
{
    "filter": {
        ">createdTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
        ">movedTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
        ">updatedTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
        "<createdTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00",
        "<movedTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00",
        "<updatedTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00"
    }
}
```

6. **Find items that were either created, modified, or moved between March 19 and March 22**

```json
{
    "filter": {
        "logic":"OR",
        "0":{
             ">createdTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
             "<createdTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00"
        },
        "1":{
             ">movedTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
             "<movedTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00"
        },
        "2":{
             ">updatedTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
             "<updatedTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00"
        }
    }
}
```
