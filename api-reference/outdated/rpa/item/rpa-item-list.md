## Response in case of success

> 200 OK

The response will contain only the main fields of the elements, without data about tasks and users of the elements:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {},
        {}
    ]
}
```

## Filter Examples

1. **Find elements that have uncompleted tasks for the current user**

    ```json
    {
        "filter": {
            "tasks": "has_tasks"
        }
    }
    ```

    To find elements that do not have tasks for the user, you need to pass the value `no_tasks`.

2. **Find elements updated by the user with identifier 4**

    ```json
    {
        "filter": {
            "=updatedBy": "4"
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Find elements updated or moved by the user with identifier 4**

    ```json
    {
        "filter": {
            "logic": "or",
            "0": {
                "=updatedBy": "4"
            },
            "1": {
                "=movedBy": "4"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Find elements that have a filled custom field with code `UF_RPA_1_STRING`**

    ```json
    {
        "filter": {
            "!=UF_RPA_1_STRING": "",
        }
    }
    ```

5. **Find elements that were created, modified, and moved between March 19 and March 22**

    ```json
    {
        "filter": {
            ">createdTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
            ">movedTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
            ">updatedTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
            "<createdTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00",
            "<movedTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00",
            "<updatedTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00"
        }
    }
    ```

6. **Find elements that were either created, modified, or moved between March 19 and March 22**

    ```json
    {
        "filter": {
            "logic":"OR",
            "0":{
                ">createdTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
                "<createdTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00"
            },
            "1":{
                ">movedTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
                "<movedTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00"
            },
            "2":{
                ">updatedTime":"2020-03-19T02:00:00+02:00",
                "<updatedTime":"2020-03-22T02:00:00+02:00"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
