A set of methods for managing field visibility settings.

In addition to custom fields, you can manage the visibility of system fields in the kanban card.

System fields have the following codes:

- `id` - id of the entity
- `createdBy` - who created it
- `updatedBy` - who modified it
- `movedBy` - who changed the stage
- `createdTime` - creation time
- `updatedTime` - modification time
- `movedTime` - stage change time
