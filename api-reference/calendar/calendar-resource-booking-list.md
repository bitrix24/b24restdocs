## Examples

**First option:** to assess the bookings (availability) of specific resources over a certain period. It can be used to create custom availability views or for use in logic.

```js
BX24.callMethod("calendar.resource.booking.list", {
    filter: {
        resourceTypeIdList: [10852, 10888, 10873, 10871, 10853], // a list of resource IDs that can be selected using the calendar.resource.list method
        from: '2018-06-20',
        to: '2018-08-20',
    }
});
```

**Second option:** the ability to select bookings by their IDs (these are the values of the UF field associated with the CRM entity).

```js
BX24.callMethod("calendar.resource.booking.list", {
    filter: {
        resourceIdList: [10, 18, 17] // these IDs are taken from the UF field value of type resourcebooking for CRM entities LEAD|DEAL
    }
});
```

## Response in case of success

Returns data about each booking. Bookings have identical fields to events, as they are essentially events.
