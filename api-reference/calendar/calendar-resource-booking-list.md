## Examples

**First option:** to assess bookings (availability) of specific resources over a certain period. It can be used to create custom availability views or for use in logic.

{% list tabs %}

- JS

    ```js
    BX24.callMethod("calendar.resource.booking.list", {
        filter: {
            resourceTypeIdList: [10852, 10888, 10873, 10871, 10853], // a list of resource IDs that can be selected using the calendar.resource.list method
            from: '2018-06-20',
            to: '2018-08-20',
        }
    });
    ```

{% endlist %}

**Second option:** the ability to select bookings by their IDs (these are the values of the UF field associated with the CRM entity).

{% list tabs %}

- JS

    ```js
    BX24.callMethod("calendar.resource.booking.list", {
        filter: {
            resourceIdList: [10, 18, 17] // these IDs are taken from the UF field value of type resourcebooking for CRM entities LEAD|DEAL
        }
    });
    ```

{% endlist %}

## Response in case of success

Returns data about each booking. Bookings have identical fields to events, as they are essentially events.
