The `OnCalendarSectionAdd` event is triggered when a calendar section is added ([CALENDAR_SECTION_ID](https://dev.quickbooks.com/user_help/components/content/calendar/calendar_events_list.php)). It will also be invoked when a resource is added.

## What the handler receives

Data is transmitted in the form of a POST request {.b24-info}

Event for creating a calendar section object `id = 202`:

```json
{
  "event": "ONCALENDARSECTIONADD",
  "event_handler_id": "6",
  "data": {
    "id": "202"
  },
  "ts":"1734608536",
  "auth": {
    "access_token": "s6p6eclrvim6da22ft9ch94ekreb52lv",
    "expires_in": "3600",
    "scope": "calendar",

    "application_token": "51856fefc120afa4b628cc82d3935cce"
  }
}
```

{% note info %}

Technically, a resource is equivalent to a section. Since the created resources are placed in a special type of calendars and a section is created for each resource, these events will be triggered when resources are added or removed.
