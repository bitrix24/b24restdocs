The `OnCalendarSectionAdd` event is triggered when a calendar section is added. It will also be triggered when a resource is added.

The following data is passed to the handler:

#|
|| **Field** | **Description** ||
|| **ID** | Identifier of the entity that triggered the event. ||
|#

{% note info %}

Technically, a resource is equivalent to a section. Since the created resources are placed in a special type of calendars and a section is created for each resource, these events will be triggered when resources are added or removed.
