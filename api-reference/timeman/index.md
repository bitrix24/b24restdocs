## Several Examples

Examples of operation on the old core.

Confirming a work report with a positive rating on the page `/timeman/work_report.php`:

```php
CModule::IncludeModule('timeman');

$ID = 8;
$arFields = array(
    "MARK" => "G", // "G" - positive, "B" - negative, "N" - no rating, "X" - without confirmation
);

if ($arFields["MARK"] != "X")
{
    $arFields["APPROVER"] = $USER->GetID();
    $arFields["APPROVE"] = "Y";
    $arFields["APPROVE_DATE"] = ConvertTimeStamp(time(), "FULL");
}
else
{
    $arFields["APPROVE"] = "N";
    $arFields["APPROVER"] = 0;
    $arFields["APPROVE_DATE"] = "";
}

$result = CTimeManReportFull::Update($ID, $arFields);
var_dump($result);
```

Working with an employee's workday

```php
CModule::IncludeModule('timeman');
$USER_ID = 1;
$report = "";
$obUser = new CTimeManUser($USER_ID);

$obUser->OpenDay($timestamp, $report); // open the workday
$obUser->CloseDay($timestamp, $report); // close the workday
$state = $oTimeManUser->State(); // get the status of the workday for employee $USER_ID
$arInfo = $oTimeManUser->GetCurrentInfo(); // information about the workday for employee $USER_ID

// Data about the active task
CModule::IncludeModule('tasks');
$oTaskTimer = CTaskTimerManager::getInstance($USER_ID);
$rs = $oTaskTimer->getLastTimer();
```
