The method `timeman.open` starts a new workday or resumes a closed or paused one.

## Parameters

#|
|| **Parameter** | **Description** ||
|| **USER_ID**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | User identifier. Optional, defaults to the settings of the current user. ||
|| **TIME**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | Start time of the workday. Optional, defaults to the current moment with the employee's saved time zone. The date must match the current calendar date. ||
|| **REPORT**^*^
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | Reason for changing the workday. Required when specifying the TIME parameter and when the employee's flexible schedule is disabled. ||
|| **LAT**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | Geographic latitude at the start of the workday. Optional. ||
|| **LON**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | Geographic longitude at the start of the workday. Optional. ||
|#

{% include [Parameter Notes](../../../_includes/required.md) %}

The time zone from the TIME parameter is considered the time zone of the current workday. The employee sees the time in this time zone, and the end time of the day is adjusted to this time zone, even if specified in another. The TIME parameter is accepted only if the workday is in the CLOSED status; in all other cases, an error will be returned.
