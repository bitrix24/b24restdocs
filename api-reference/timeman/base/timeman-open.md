The method `timeman.open` starts a new work day or resumes a closed or paused one.

## Parameters

#|
|| **Parameter** | **Description** ||
|| **USER_ID**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | User identifier. Optional; defaults to the settings of the current user. ||
|| **TIME**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | Start time of the work day. Optional; defaults to the current moment with the employee's saved time zone. The date must match the current calendar date. ||
|| **REPORT**^*^
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | Reason for changing the work day. Required when the TIME parameter is specified and the employee's flexible schedule is disabled. ||
|| **LAT**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | Geographic latitude of the start of the work day. Optional. ||
|| **LON**
[`unknown`](../../data-types.md) | Geographic longitude of the start of the work day. Optional. ||
|#

{% include [Parameter Note](../../../_includes/required.md) %}

The time zone from the TIME parameter is considered the time zone of the current work day. The employee sees the time in this time zone, and the end time of the day is adjusted to this time zone, even if specified in another. The TIME parameter is accepted only if the work day is in the CLOSED status; in all other cases, an error will be returned.
