This method allows you to retrieve a file from a user field.

## Example

There is a field `UF_USR_1604998606834` of type file. By calling the [user.current](../user-current.md) method, you can get the file in this field for the current user, where:
- **showUrl** - is the URL that will display the file in the browser if the user is authenticated;
- **downloadData** - the data that should be submitted to this method.

```
[UF_USR_1604998606834] => Array
(
    [id] => 774
    [showUrl] => /bitrix/services/main/ajax.php?action=rest.file.get&SITE_ID=s1&entity=USER&id=1&field=UF_USR_1604998606834&value=774
    [downloadData] => Array
        (
            [id] => 1
            [field] => UF_USR_1604998606834
            [value] => 774
        )
)
```
