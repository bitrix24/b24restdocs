# Localization of the Template

{% note warning "We are still updating this page" %}

Some data may be missing here â€” we will fill it in shortly.

{% endnote %}

If you anticipate distributing templates not only in the native language segment, then the actual content of the pages should be in a universal language, English. You can provide titles and descriptions of the pages in the original language, but when registering the template, it is necessary to submit the localization array. For more details, see [here](./landing-demos-register.md).
