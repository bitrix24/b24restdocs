Access permissions are available starting from version 18.7.0.

Permissions can only be granted by the account administrator, and only if the project plan is paid (in the case of the cloud). Currently, permissions can only be granted for sites, and they apply to all nested pages. For example, the permission "Change settings," granted for a site, applies to the site's settings page and the settings pages of any of its subpages.

{% note warning %}

If the account transitions from a paid category to a free one, the permission functionality is automatically disabled, and all restricted entities become accessible to everyone.
