{% note info "landing.landing.removeEntities" %}

**Scope**: [`landing`](../../../scopes/permissions.md) | **Who can execute the method**: `any user`

{% endnote %}

The method `landing.landing.removeEntities` deletes related entities of the landing page - blocks and images of the blocks.

{% note warning %}

When blocks are deleted, the associated images are removed as well. However, there may be situations where you need to delete images independently of the blocks to clean up clutter. Use this method in that case.

{% endnote %}

```js
BX24.callMethod(
    'landing.landing.removeEntities',
    {
        lid: 648,
        data: {
            blocks: [12167, 123],
            images: [
                {
                    block: 12269,
                    image: 6866
                },
                {
                    block: 12268,
                    image: 6861
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    function(result)
    {
        if(result.error())
        {
            console.error(result.error());
        }
        else
        {
            console.info(result.data());
        }
    }
);
// In this example, we are deleting blocks with IDs 12167, 123, as well as image 6866 (from block 12269) and image 6861 (from block 12268).
// All entities are located in landing page 648.
