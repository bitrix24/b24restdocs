The method `landing.landing.removeEntities` removes related entities of the landing page - blocks and images of the blocks.

{% note warning %}

When blocks are deleted, the associated images are removed in any case. However, there may be situations where it is necessary to delete images independently of the block to clean up junk. Use this method in such cases.
