Currently, the system features color themes listed below. It's important to note that the template includes both a visual display theme (forms, colors) and a font theme. The website based on the template is always created with a specific color theme and a specific font theme. Typically, they match (the font theme is a small additional file). When a user changes the visual theme, the font theme remains unchanged and can only be modified programmatically by the developer. This is intentional system behavior.

{% note info %}

Theme names with numbers at the beginning are not a typo. Some themes are indeed named this way.
