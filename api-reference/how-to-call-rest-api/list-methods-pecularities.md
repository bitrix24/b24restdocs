# Features of List Methods

In the REST API, there are several methods that return lists of entitiesâ€”lists of deals, users, task comments, etc.

Since the number of returned entities depends on specific conditions and parameters, *Bitrix24* returns them in "batches" of several items (currently no more than 50 at a time).

Example:

```http
https://your-domain.bitrix24.com/rest/crm.item.list?entityTypeId=183&auth=d161f25928c3184678924ec127edd29a

//get a list of all custom CRM entities with ID 183 in JSON format.
```

When calling list methods, REST returns additional values in the response:

```json
{
    "result": result of the method execution,
    "error": error of the method execution,
    "total": total number of records in the response of the list method,
    "next": value to be sent to get the next page of data from the list method
}
```

To retrieve the next batch of entities, you need to execute the same request, specifying an additional parameter `start` with the value received in the `next` parameter of the response. When using [SDK BX24.js](../bx24-js-sdk/index.md), obtaining the next batch is done using the method `result.next()`.

Executing list methods can be quite "heavy" in terms of performance for *Bitrix24*, as the volume of processed data can be very large. To ensure your applications stay within the [limits of the REST API](../performance/limits.md), we recommend [reading the article](../performance/huge-data.md).
