Even though neural networks are quite intelligent creations, it's essential to know how to communicate with them effectively. An average user cannot (and essentially should not) know how to do this. This is where so-called pre-prompts come into play.

{% note tip " " %}

**Pre-prompts** are texts that accompany the user request.

{% endnote %}

Proper emphasis in a pre-prompt guides the neural network on what exactly it needs to do, even if the user has not articulated their thoughts very clearly. A more practical example is when a user simply presses the "translate" button, and we need to create a pre-prompt for accurate translation behind the scenes.

In this section of the documentation, we will explain what pre-prompts are, how to write them, and how to register them via REST.
