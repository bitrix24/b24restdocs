Bitrix24 is an online service that brings together all the necessary tools for company operations and business management. Consolidate and automate all work communications, sales, projects, and workflows in one space.

The Bitrix24 REST API is a public API for creating integrations, automating workflows, and customizing user scenarios in Bitrix24.

## About the Documentation

This project serves as the official repository for the Bitrix24 REST API documentation, which is used to build the [online version](https://apidocs.bitrix24.com/).

It is based on the "Documentation as Code" paradigm:

- Documentation development takes place in an environment familiar to developers;
- The use of [extended Markdown format](https://diplodoc.com/docs/en/syntax/) for content provides all the necessary elements for formatting materials;
- The structure and format of the source materials simplify future localization tasks;
- Version control ensures transparent mechanisms for making changes.

## For Contributors

You can help others by correcting errors in the documentation, adding useful edits, or even entire articles.

We welcome contributions and the emergence of new materials, believing that your practical experience as developers using the Bitrix24 REST API will assist those who are just starting to explore the API.
