# Versioning of Modules in On-Premise Bitrix24

When developing applications, it's important to consider that the REST methods and events available for use in cloud Bitrix24 may not be accessible in specific on-premise installations.

Firstly, the release schedule for updates in Bitrix24 for the on-premise version differs from that of the cloud version, as these updates require a separate testing cycle, among other considerations.

Secondly, obtaining updates in on-premise installations occurs "at the initiative" of the specific on-premise installation. In other words, this process is initiated by the administrator of that particular on-premise Bitrix24, meaning that new features already available in cloud Bitrix24 may not "reach" the specific on-premise installation by the time your application is installed on it.

If users of your application encounter issues during operation on their on-premise version of Bitrix24 due to the absence of existing REST API functionality, and you, as the developer, do not have administrative access to that on-premise installation, you can refer to our documentation to provide users with information on which updates they need to download.

If you are the administrator of the on-premise installation, you can independently update Bitrix24 to the latest available version.

You can find the list of versions for all modules in the on-premise version in the administrative section: Settings > Product Settings > Modules.
