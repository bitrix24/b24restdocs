# Overview of Tools for Local Integrations

Tools for "local integrations" help solve specific automation tasks on a given Bitrix24 account.

What tasks are you most likely to encounter?

- Importing data into the CRM or another tool.
- Integrations with internal accounting or inventory management systems.
- Simple automation related to bulk processing of customer data.
- Embedding a couple of your buttons in the right places within Bitrix24.

To tackle these tasks, it's best to use the REST API along with the convenient tools found in the [Developer resources](developers-area.md) section of Bitrix24, where you will find ready-made examples for typical tasks using [incoming and outgoing webhooks](local-webhooks.md), as well as [local applications](local-apps.md).
