### September 2024

We have completely revamped the documentation for the REST API and changed the internal principles of its updates.

- All materials have been converted to the markdown format accepted in the international developer community for technical documentation;
- We have combined separate existing materials and courses into a unified REST API documentation (the only exception remains the [video course](https://helpdesk.bitrix24.com/courses/index.php?COURSE_ID=268&INDEX=Y), which is intended for a quick overview);
- The structure of the materials has been largely revised. We aimed to present the abundance of information in a sequence that helps address practical issues. We continue to work on improving the structure;
- Many articles on methods, events, and widgets have been completely rewritten. We have tried to make them as clear as possible while being as detailed as possible. Together with the developers of Bitrix24, we continue to work on revising those articles that still contain incomplete information;
- All materials are available on [github](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24restdocs) under the MIT license. We hope for your assistance in improving the documentation and welcome your edits, articles, and code examples. We promise to review any pull request as quickly as possible and monitor issues.
