# How Bitrix24 REST API can be used

Bitrix24 provides developers with tools to extend functionality and integrate external services through the REST API.

- Create your own solutions.
- Automate processes.
- Enhance user interactions with clients and employees.

We discuss the key areas of development on the Bitrix24 platform.

## Add Your Own Automation Tools to Bitrix24

Developers can make the Bitrix24 platform even more flexible and powerful by adding their own automation tools:

1. Automation rules and triggers in CRM.
2. Workflow actions.
3. Smart scripts in automation rules.
4. REST API event handlers.

This increases the efficiency of the company: it simplifies routine tasks, minimizes errors, speeds up data processing, and improves client interactions.

### Automation Rules and Triggers in CRM

[Automation rules](./api-reference/bizproc/bizproc-robot/index.md) in CRM can automatically send e-mails to clients after certain events, such as after registration on the website or a purchase. [Triggers](./api-reference/crm/automation/index.md) can activate automation rules when the status of documents or orders changes in external systems.

This allows for the automation of sales and enhances their effectiveness. Automation rules and triggers are especially useful in sales and marketing departments, where engaging clients and increasing conversion rates is crucial.

### Workflow Actions

[Workflow actions](./api-reference/bizproc/index.md) automate the approval of documents: leave requests, invoice approvals, and other standard procedures. This reduces the time spent on processing requests and improves organizational efficiency within the company.

Developers can integrate actions with external systems, such as time tracking or project management systems.

### Smart Scripts in Automation Rules

[Smart scripts](./settings/app-installation/smart-scripts-installation.md) offer even more flexible automation. This low-code application allows you to set a sequence of actions for automation rules. The automation rules will pass parameters and report intermediate results of individual actions.

Smart scripts work in sales funnels and leads, as well as in contacts and companies. They can be triggered for groups of CRM entities. For example, you can set up a script that analyzes client behavior on the website based on data from the CRM contact and sends personalized offers based on the client's interests.

Developers can add their own automation rules with unique capabilities and use them in smart scripts.

### REST API Event Handlers

[Event handlers](./api-reference/events/index.md) respond to actions in the Bitrix24 system: adding a new contact or changing data in a deal.

This allows developers to create integrations with external services, such as analytics systems, email marketing, or ERP systems. Such integrations can automatically update data in external systems, notify employees of important events, and synchronize information between platforms.

## Add Communication Tools with Employees and Clients

In Bitrix24, you can integrate chatbots, connectors for messengers, SMS providers, and telephony. This speeds up request processing and optimizes internal processes, allowing clients to reach you where it is convenient for them.

### Create Chatbots

[Chatbots](./api-reference/chat-bots/index.md) are used in both internal and external communications.

Chatbots effectively handle initial customer support, answer frequently asked questions, conduct surveys, gather preliminary information, and pass it on to operators.

Within the company, chatbots help employees quickly navigate knowledge bases, remind them of important events and tasks.

### Custom Open Line Connectors

Messages from clients in messengers can come into your Bitrix24. WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, or special messengers within marketplaces can be integrated with Bitrix24 using [open line connectors](./api-reference/imopenlines/imconnector/index.md). This ensures a high level of client engagement and ease of use.

### Add Your Own SMS Providers

You can send SMS from Bitrix24 by connecting an [SMS provider](./api-reference/messageservice/index.md). This can include notifications about order status, reminders about events, and marketing campaigns. This functionality is especially in demand in regions with limited internet access.

### Integrate Telephony

Integrating Bitrix24 with [telephony](./api-reference/telephony/index.md) automates calls, records conversations, tracks statistics, and automatically creates deals or tasks based on incoming calls. This improves customer service quality and enhances the efficiency of the sales department.

## Publish Business Content

Use ready-made templates for [landing pages, websites, and online stores](./api-reference/landing/index.md) to reduce development costs.

### Ready-Made Landing Pages

Ready-made landing pages allow you to quickly launch promotional pages, product pages, event registrations, and other marketing campaigns. Entrepreneurs and marketers can create pages without deep knowledge of web development.

### Ready-Made Websites

Ready-made websites are templates for corporate sites, blogs, portfolios, and other types of websites. The templates already have structure and design; you just need to adapt them for your business.

### Ready-Made Online Stores

With a ready-made online store, you can quickly launch online sales. The key difference from regular websites is the pre-configured functions for managing products, orders, payments, and delivery. With a ready-made online store, you can focus on expanding your product range and marketing, avoiding the technical complexities of launching.

### Standard Document Templates

These simplify the creation of contracts, invoices, estimates, and other business documents. [Templates](./api-reference/document-generator/templates/index.md) help standardize document flow and reduce the likelihood of errors. Standard templates will be useful for sales departments, legal, and financial services.

## Integrations with Payment Systems and Delivery Services

Integrations ensure a seamless payment process for goods and services, simplify logistics and delivery, and help manage and control financial operations in accordance with the law.

### Integrations with Payment Systems

Clients will be able to pay for purchases through convenient [payment methods](./api-reference/pay-system/index.md): credit cards, electronic wallets, and online banking. This is important for online stores, online course platforms, and booking services.

### Integrations with Delivery Services

Integration with [delivery services](./api-reference/sale/delivery/index.md) allows for the automation of delivery cost calculations, tracking packages, and managing orders. This improves customer service quality and optimizes logistics processes.

By offering solutions for integration with payment systems and delivery services, developers can enhance the operational efficiency of businesses operating on the Bitrix24 platform. Understanding the needs and use cases for these tools allows for the creation of applications and services that will be in demand in the market and provide value.

## Expanding Existing Functionality of Bitrix24 Tools with Widget Integrations

Built-in solutions in the Bitrix24 interface significantly expand functionality. You can [add new widgets](./api-reference/widgets/index.md), analytics tools, dashboards, and much more. This approach improves user experience, optimizes workflows, and increases overall productivity when working with the system.

### Widgets in CRM

Widgets in CRM can display additional information about a client, such as recent purchases, preferences, and communication history from social networks or external databases. Sales managers can see the complete picture when interacting with a client.

### Integration of Analytics Tools

Analytics widgets help quickly obtain the necessary information for decision-making. They display key performance indicators (KPIs), sales reports, website traffic analytics, or the effectiveness of advertising campaigns within the Bitrix24 interface.

### Custom Dashboards

Developers can create specialized dashboards to track projects, tasks, finances, or any other aspects of the business that require monitoring.

### Integration with External Services

Built-in tools can provide integration with external services such as email, calendars, and time tracking systems. This allows for data synchronization and management of all processes from a single interface.

Developing built-in solutions for Bitrix24 opens up opportunities for improving and personalizing the workspace of companies. Developers who understand business needs can create in-demand applications and integrations.
